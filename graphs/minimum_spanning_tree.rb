# A Spanning Tree is a graph which has N nodes and N - 1 edges; and all nodes are reachable from each other
# From all the possible spanning trees the one which is having the minimum sum of all edge weights is the minimum spannig tree
# Prims and Kruskal's algorithms are used to find the MST of a graph
