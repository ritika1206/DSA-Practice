- wherever heap cannot fit in, try to think about monotonic stack
- next greater/smaller element/element_index and previous greater/smaller element/element_index is utilised in majority of problems

patterns
- whenever we talk about `next greater/smaller` then always nove from end to begin to prepare monotonic stack
  - for nge, monotonic stack will be in decreasing order
  - for nse, monotonic stack will be in increasing order
- whenever we talk about `previous greater/smaller` then always nove from begin to end to prepare monotonic stack
- elements are pushed into the stack and popped from the stack based on some condition
- for problems involving finding max area of histogram or maximal rectangle of grid involves finding pse and nse
