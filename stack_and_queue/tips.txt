- wherever heap cannot fit in, try to think about monotonic stack
- next greater/smaller element/element_index and previous greater/smaller element/element_index is utilised in majority of problems

patterns
- elements are pushed into the stack and popped from the stack based on some condition
- for problems involving finding max area of histogram or maximal rectangle of grid involves finding pse and nse
